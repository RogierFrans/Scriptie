# Hello, Interesting Person!

Welcome to my repository for my thesis! the main result of my thesis is a cookie paywall tool designed for managers.  With this app, you can check if your website's characteristics match those of sites that already use a pay-or-okay cookiewall. Plus, it estimates a competitive price for you.
Besides the tool all the data analytics I have done for my [research](link) can also be seen here

## What is a Pay-or-Okay Cookiewall?

In simple terms, a pay-or-okay cookie paywall is a system where if a user refuses to be tracked, they must pay a fee to access the website. Essentially, users have three options:
1. Accept personal data processing (cookies).
2. Pay a small fee (usually monthly) to access the website.
3. Leave the website.
